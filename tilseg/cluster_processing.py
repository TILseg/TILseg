"""
This python file is meant to generate human and computer readable data for
analysis based on the clusters generated via the clustering model previously
developed. The output is a series of images which represent the
original image and relevant overlays of the determined clusters. Additionally,
based on the clusters, data from filtered cell clusters will be compiled into
a CSV. Immune cell groups are identified using the contour functionality from
OpenCV. The implemented filters are based on area and roundness of the derived
contours.
