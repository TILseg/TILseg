## User Stories
**Immediate Future User: Tool Developer (Bob)**<br> 
Bob is a graduate student whose research focuses on developing translational cancer diagnostic tools. Bob wants to adapt this software such that the input is a multiplexed immunofluorescent image instead of an H&E-stained image. Bob will work directly with the python scripts from this project. Bob is technically advanced, but inexperienced with image processing. For this reason, he needs a software package that is thorough in external documentation and internal commentary.

**Immediate Future User: Package User (Maria)**<br>
Maria is a research scientist whose work requires use and analysis of H&E stained images. From these images, Maria must be able to identify and enumerate immune cells in the sample. She will use this software package to aquire these parameters from recently aquired H&E stained images. Maria does not have a programming background. She hopes to integrate this software into a larger workflow that evaluates treatment outcomes based on disease subtypes.

**Distance Future User: Biotechnology Software Developer (Alice)**<br>
Alice works at an imaging machine manufacturer as a software developer. She is looking to create similar software that works directly with a new machine developed by her employer. To this end, the imaging machine would automate image segmentation of H&E stained images. Alice will work directly with the python scripts from this project. Alice is techincally advanced, and specialzies in image processing. However, she has no experience with H&E stained images. She hopes that this software will inform her of the unique challenges associated with H&E stained images. Like Bob, Alice needs well documented software to inform her design.

**Final User: Clinician (Robert)**<br>
Robert is a clinical pathologist. He would like to use this software to reduce variance in diagnoses between him and his colleagues. Robert would not work directly with the script and intead requires a user interface. Robert is an expert in H&E stained image analysis, but is not techonoligcally savvy. Robert will need an easy to use interface with a clear output.
